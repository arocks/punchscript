# Starting the configuration file with a preset ensures you won't fallback to
# definitions from "~/.ocp/ocp-indent.conf".
# These are `normal`, `apprentice` and `JaneStreet` and set different defaults.
normal

# Indent after `match/try with` or `function`:
#    match foo with
#    ^^| _ -> bar
with=0

# You can also add syntax extensions (as per the --syntax command-line option):
syntax=lwt mll

# When nesting expressions on the same line, their indentation are in
# some cases stacked, so that it remains correct if you close them one
# at a line. This may lead to large indents in complex code though, so
# this parameter can be used to set a maximum value. Note that it only
# affects indentation after function arrows and opening parens at end
# of line.
#
# for example (left: `none`; right: `4`)
#    let f = g (h (i (fun x ->     #    let f = g (h (i (fun x ->
#          x)                      #        x)
#        )                         #      )
#      )                           #    )
